Create a repo in github.
in AWS, create an app in aws amplify: (web host)
Go through the prompts to connect to github repository



Route 53 
go to hosted zones and create one. 
Add godaddy url and let it find it.  Wait til it verifies.

When IDs appear, use them to create CNames in godaddy (DNS management)
The first cname in aws to copy appears once the domain name is cerified.  the second is found in DNS..?  activity?  in dropdown somewhere on the main screen.
Don't use the aname at all.  Just the cnames. 


troubleshooting:
The region (top of aws near username) matters.  If you have the wrong one selected it won't show all your apps.
